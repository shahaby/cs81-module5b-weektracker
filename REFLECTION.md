# Reflection on Weekly Activity Tracker

1. **Were your predictions accurate?**

   - My predictions were mostly accurate.

2. **What surprised you about your week?**

   - I was surprised by how much time I spent on creative activities.

3. **Which higher-order function was most useful and why?**
   - The filterByCondition() func was the only and most useful because it allowed me to query custom conditions in my activities.
